Project Title: AI Tic Tac Toe with GUI – Prompt-Engineered Opponent

This project is a fully interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and the Tkinter library, featuring a smart AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. It’s designed to showcase how prompt engineering principles can influence AI decision-making in a structured environment like a game.

Key Features:

Clickable 3x3 game board (GUI-based using Tkinter)

AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves

Player uses the mouse to place moves (X); the AI responds with (O)

Visual win detection and feedback (color changes, status messages)

Restart button appears after each game (win, lose, or draw)

Clean, modern dark-themed UI for an enhanced user experience

Prompt Engineering Relevance:
The Minimax logic mirrors prompt engineering methods: it scores potential outcomes, simulates user paths, and strategically selects the optimal response. This project acts as a practical application of decision-tree thinking in AI prompt design.
